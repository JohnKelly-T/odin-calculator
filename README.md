# Calculator 

A responsive, interactive calculator built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum.

## 🖱️ Project Overview

This is the final project for The Odin Project Foundations course designed to put essential front-end skills to the test — combining layout, styling, and logic to create a fully functional calculator app from scratch. It handles basic arithmetic and includes a clean, user-friendly interface.

### ✨ Features

- Clickable number and operator buttons
- Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear and delete functions
- Display updates in real-time
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Expression parsing using the **Shunting Yard Algorithm** for correct order of operations

## 💡 Core Skills Practiced

- **DOM manipulation** – capturing user input through events and updating the display dynamically  
- **JavaScript functions** – implementing logic for math operations and expression evaluation  
- **Shunting Yard Algorithm** – parsing infix expressions into postfix (RPN) to apply operator precedence and associativity correctly  
- **Flexbox** – designing and laying out the calculator interface  
- **Event handling** – using event listeners to make the calculator interactive  
- **State management** – tracking operands, operators, and results accurately  
- **Debugging** – handling edge cases like division by zero, invalid input, or long expressions
